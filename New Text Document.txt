Safe & Damage-Free Removal.
At Winnipeg Pinball Collective (WPC), we understand that moving large, heavy pinball machines can be tricky. That’s why we take great care to ensure your home remains damage-free throughout the process. Our team uses professional-grade dollies and padding to safely navigate tight corners, doorways, and stairs. We handle each machine with precision, avoiding any scuffs or dings to walls or floors. We also provide our own trucks, so there’s no need to worry about transportation. With years of experience moving and restoring pinball machines, we guarantee a smooth, hassle-free removal—leaving your space just as it was, minus the pinball machine.
